# Cloud Deployment Manager: Qubole Deployment 

<h2>What is Cloud Deployment Manager?</h2>
<p>
    Google Cloud Deployment Manager allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml. 
    You can also use Python or Jinja2 templates to parameterize the configuration and allow reuse of common deployment paradigms such as a load balanced, auto-scaled instance group. 
    Treat your configuration as code and perform repeatable deployments.
